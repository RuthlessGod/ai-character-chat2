Below, I provide markdown files for each Python file in the Flask-based application for managing AI-powered characters. Each markdown describes the file's functions, its role in the application, and how it interacts with other files. The application appears to be split across multiple files, with some functionality duplicated or moved into separate modules. I'll base the markdowns on the provided code snippets, focusing on the latest versions of each module where applicable.

### Summary
This documentation outlines each Python module's purpose, functionality, and interactions within the Flask application, along with the integrated systems they form. The app is a modular system where `app.py` ties together components for configuration (`config.py`), AI integration (`ai_integration.py`), character management (`character_management.py`, `character_generation.py`), chat (`chat_management.py`, `chat_instances.py`, `player_actions.py`, `scene_generation.py`, `memory_management.py`), system oversight (`system_management.py`), and prompt handling (`prompt_management.py`). Each module leverages shared resources like `Config` and interacts through function calls and file system operations to deliver a robust AI character interaction platform.
